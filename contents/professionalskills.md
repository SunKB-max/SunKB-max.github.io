#### Research Innovation & Data- driven Insight
- **Quantitative Research Expertise**: Led end-to-end quantitative research; published 20+ peer-reviewed articles and 1 monograph, and built scalable, reproducible workflows.

- **Data Wrangling & Processing**: Built robust pipelines to clean, transform, and integrate complex, messy, multi-source datasets (e.g., text, imagery, location-based mobility data, remote sensing), using advanced spatial-statistical techniques to support actionable, data-driven decisions.

- **Data Visualization & Communication**: Translated complex analytical findings into clear, compelling visual narratives; presented at 7+ conferences, taught 8+ courses, mentored junior researchers, and produced stakeholder-focused insights for academic and applied audiences.

- **Geospatial Analysis Proficiency**: Proficient in spatial modeling, predictive mapping, temporal analysis, and multimodal data integration in real-world applications.

#### Project Leadership & Real-World Applications
- **Research Leadership (PI)**: Led 6 funded research projects as Principal Investigator, managing full-cycle workflows, timelines, and interdisciplinary research teams to deliver policy-relevant insights.

- **Real Estate Project Leadership**: Directed 2 urban development projects (residential community & cruise terminal) between 2016 and 2019, coordinating with 4+ stakeholder groups and guiding spatial layout execution. Successfully supported completion of projects covering 100,000+ m2.  

- **Strategic Consulting Engagement**: Advised on the Medical Mall Project (2024), leveraging geospatial analytics and predictive modeling to optimize spatial layout. Helped improve projected operational efficiency and supported investment decision-making.
